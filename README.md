## TODO:
* Pin placement is currently dumb and just places all 
the pins on one side iteratively without trying to
first place pre-determined pin locations and then 
auto-determining the remainder. This need to be
implemented.
* Might make more sense to make the rectangles 
themselves objects and work with that.
* Some information is gotten from inconsistent sources.
This need refactoring.
